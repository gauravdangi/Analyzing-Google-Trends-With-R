Analyzing which TV show is trending

Google Trends is a public web facility of Google Inc., based on Google Search, that shows how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages.
Here I have done analysis of three popular TV shows ,i.e., Game of thrones, How I met your mother and The Flash.
Results clearly shows that Game of thrones is more popular and trending show.
